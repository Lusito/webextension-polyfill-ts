# Web-Extension Polyfill for TypeScript

This is a TypeScript ready "wrapper" for the [WebExtension browser API Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) by Mozilla.
* It does not include webextension-polyfill, but it is required as a peer dependency. You need to manually install and load/execute it where necessary.
* It is generated from these mozilla schema (.json) files:
  * [toolkit](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/raw-file/tip/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/)
  * [browser](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/raw-file/tip/browser/components/extensions/schemas/)

## How to use:
This guide assumes you are building a web-extension using npm and webpack, parcel or similar.
If you are looking for an example use-case, check out the development branch of my web-extension [Forget Me Not](https://github.com/lusito/forget-me-not/tree/develop).

* `npm install --save-dev webextension-polyfill-ts`
* `import "webextension-polyfill-ts";`
  * Adds types for the global `browser` object.
  * Use `browser` as usual to access the browser API.

If you want to use specific exported types in your code, simply import them like this:
```typescript
import { Cookies } from "webextension-polyfill-ts";

function inspectCookie(cookie: Cookies.Cookie) {
    //...
}
```

All types are inside their respective namespace:
* Namespaces are named like their API, but with the first character as upper-case.
  * For example `browser.cookies` types are in the `Cookies` namespace
* Nested namespaces will remove the dot and have the first character after the dot as upper-case.
  * For example `browser.devtools.inspectedWindow` types are in the `DevtoolsInspectedWindow` namespace.

## Unit Testing
Consider [mockzilla-webextension](https://lusito.github.io/mockzilla-webextension/) for unit-testing. It combines all the types this package provides with some nifty mocking functionality.

## Issues
There are still some issues left:
* Since the schema .json files have a lot of anonymous nested types, some of the types will have generated names.
  * These might change in the future, since the generated names are far from perfect.
* Some of the schema files are incomplete.. for example in some places, a null value is allowed, yet the schema file doesn't say anything about it. I have fixed some of these, but there are probably more.
* Not every API has been tested.
